This App is made using a custom layout for each item in GridView,
a model class for custom data structure for storing data for each item 
and Custom adapter to layout the views and bind the data from the datasource. 
It also has a onClick feature on each item which displays a second screen where
the user interacts and inputs the dimensions of the shape and gets the Volume as result.
